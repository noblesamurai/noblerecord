# noblerecord
##### <span style="color: #333">a Rails-inspired ORM system for mysql and node.js</span> 

## introduction

As an evented I/O framework, node lends itself naturally to data transfer and distribution purposes. However, it is limited in this role by the lack of a solid means of database access that retains asynchronicity. NobleRecord attempts to rectify this by drawing inspiration from the intuitive object-relation mapping provided by Ruby's [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.org/).

## dependencies

NobleRecord currently interfaces with mysql by way of [node-mysql-libmysqlclient](https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient).
